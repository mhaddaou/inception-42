# inception 42 tutorial 

This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker.
You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual
machine.

#  General guidelines

• This project need to be done on a Virtual Machine.
• All the files required for the configuration of your project must be placed in a srcs
folder.<br>
• A Makefile is also required and must be located at the root of your directory. It
must set up your entire application (i.e., it has to build the Docker images using
docker-compose.yml).<br>
• This subject requires putting into practice concepts that, depending on your background, you may not have learned yet. Therefore, we advise you not to hesitate to
read a lot of documentation related to Docker usage, as well as anything else you
will find helpful in order to complete this assignment.<br>

# let's start with what is Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.<br>

By using containers, developers can be sure that their applications will run consistently on any system, regardless of the differences in setup and configuration between systems. This makes it easier to develop and test applications, and to deploy them to production environments.<br>

Docker is widely used in the development and deployment of modern applications and microservices. It allows developers to build, ship, and run their applications in a container, which can be easily moved between different systems. This makes it easier to scale and manage applications, and to deploy updates and new features quickly and reliably.<br>
