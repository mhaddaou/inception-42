#  General guidelines

• This project need to be done on a Virtual Machine.
• All the files required for the configuration of your project must be placed in a srcs
folder.<br>
• A Makefile is also required and must be located at the root of your directory. It
must set up your entire application (i.e., it has to build the Docker images using
docker-compose.yml).<br>

read a lot of documentation related to Docker usage, as well as anything else you
